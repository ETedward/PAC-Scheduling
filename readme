A paragraph describing your contribution, and another paragraph 
describing your teammate's contribution. Please be thorough; 
we're looking for two substantial paragraphs, not a sentence or two.

I led the typing of the code for reg.py. I helped write and think about the 
argument parsing function parse() as well as the formatting for reg.py
in format() and readable() functions. I also led the writing and thinking
for argument parsing function checkargv() and regformat(). I helped figure out
how to do the human-readable printing with the underscores and also
most of the right justifying. I helped to debug the database functions in 
terms of the cursor.execute portions as well as parsing the data retrieved 
in regdetails.py into a list to be returned so that there are no duplicate items. 

Angela led the writing for the database for both reg.py and regdetails.py. She 
helped to come up with the INNER JOIN select statements for both of the functions 
because we were having trouble obtaining actual results from the database. Angela 
also helped debug with the ON statement for the profnames because initially we
were having all the profnames getting returned and then figured out that we had
to INNER JOIN them by profid. Angela also helped figure out and write up the bash 
scripts for reg and regdetails. She also led the writing and debugging for pformat()
in regdetails.py. Angela helped with the debugging of the formatting for readable() 
function in reg.py as well as for parse() in reg.py. 

We worked and debugged entirely side by side during the entirety of this 
assignment. We each led and came up with ideas for some individual sections but
largely done together. 

A description of whatever help (if any) you received from other people while 
doing the assignment, as prescribed by the course Policies web page.

We used Stack overflow and a few other python tutorial/documentation websites to 
get a better understanding of python syntax and for the different types of functions
that are available to us in Python and for sqlite. We also used the course handouts 
from class and also other websites from online to help us in learning how to use 
sqlite functions and calls. 
Websites that were used include:

stackoverflow.com

An indication of how much time you spent doing the assignment.
8 hours 

Your assessment of the assignment: Did it help you to learn? What did it help 
you to learn? Do you have any suggestions for improvement? Etc.
(Optionally) Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most 
favorable light. In particular you must describe all known bugs.

This assignment was relatively helpful in terms of learning how to use SELECT 
statements, writing them to be tailored to our needs, and also figuring how
to use python functions or what functions were available to us to help us 
parse the information and write what we needed. We would say that this was 
largely an experience in learning how to write in Python since (Helen) first
learned it back in high school but has not coded in Python since and this 
is Angela's first time coding in Python. This also helped refresh Angela's 
memory of Sqlite and teach Helen what SELECT statements can do. Overall,
we think this was quite an interesting assignment, however, the formatting 
portion of this assignment got quite confusing and hard especially because
we were not familiar with functions such as rjust or ljust.
